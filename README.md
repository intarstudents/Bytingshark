__Bytingshark__ - user.js who will try show to you currently playing songs file size. Works on all modern browsers like Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera and (maybe) Safari.

__P.S.__ I haven't tested newest version (2012.10.23) in all modern browsers. And some act strange for no apparent reason (Opera). May come back to it, some other day.

Install
=======

Firefox
-------

You will need to install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on. After that just open *bytingshark.user.js* and install it.

Google Chrome
-------------

Open [Tools > Extensions](chrome://chrome/extensions/) and enable 'Developer mode'. Then use 'Load unpacked extension...'.

Opera
-----

Copy *bytingshark.user.js* script into User JavaScript folder. If you don't know where yours located at (or haven't added it yet):

1.	Goto Preferences > Advanced > Content > JavaScript Options ...
2.	There will be field named "User JavaScript folder", set it where you putted *bytingshark.user.js* script.

Safari (might work, too lazy for test)
