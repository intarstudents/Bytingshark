This is my latest, handy weekend project for Grooveshark â€“ Bytingshark. The main goal of it was to be able easily see playing songs mp3 file size. From that you can assume files sound quality and that just what doctor prescribed.

What you will need for this to work:

    Firefox
    Greasemonkey
    bytingshark.user.js

Enjoy (but be aware, it might contain some bugs)!
